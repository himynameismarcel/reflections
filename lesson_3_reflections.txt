# Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

# My thoughts on this: Like any other cloud-based service, using a remote repository
rather than keeping all my files local adds two distinct features to our projects:
(1) Easy collaboration and (2) access to our files over the Web.
So if we are working on a bigger projects together with other friends and
colleagues, using a remote repository opens new doors in terms of collaboration and easily allows all participants to keep track of changes
and modifications via the commit-history.

# Question: Describe differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

# My thoughts on this:
The three terms described are three distinct features of Git and Github.
A fork is a copied Github-repository from another user.
A clone is the local copy of a Github repostiroy.
And a branch is just one distinct 'stage' of a project with the entire
project history.
