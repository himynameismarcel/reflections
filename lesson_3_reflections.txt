# Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

# My thoughts on this: Like any other cloud-based service, using a remote repository 
rather than keeping all my files local adds two distinct features to our projects: 
(1) Easy collaboration and (2) access to our files over the Web.
So if we are working on a bigger projects together with other friends and colleagues, 
using a remote repository opens new doors in terms of collaboration and easily allows 
all participants to keep track of changes and modifications via the commit-history.
